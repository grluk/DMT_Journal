# DMT_Journal
Basic Journal maker, initially to keep me learning and using Python. But also encouraging me to keep a journal for my future.

Features: (so far):
- Command line args for quicker access
- Daily file created for ease of sorting.
- Basic encoding to stop the causual nosey reader.


Wish list:
- Encryption
- Client Server setup (client to write anywhere, central storage on server)
